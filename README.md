# Autonomous_Arduino_Robot
This project is an autonomous Arduino-based robot that I designed, built, and programmed to navigate a physical track using ultrasonic sensors and a mathematically driven control system. The robot was designed to use two ultrasonic sensors (left and right) to adapt both steering and speed in real time.
